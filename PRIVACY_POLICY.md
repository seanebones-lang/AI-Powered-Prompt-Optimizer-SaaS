## LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (GDPR COMPLIANCE)

If you are located in the EEA or UK, our lawful basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate business interests. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

## WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
- **Affiliates.** We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
- **Business Partners.** We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.
- **Third-Party Service Providers.** We use xAI for AI processing (Grok 4.1 Fast). Your inputs and outputs are processed by xAI but not used for their internal training, per their terms. Data is deleted within 30 days unless flagged for safety. See xAI Privacy Policy: https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy.

## DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

Yes, we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: [link].

## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Service is at your own risk.

## DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Service, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Service. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@mothership-ai.com.

## WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

Under the GDPR, you have the right to:

- Request access and obtain a copy of your personal information.
- Request rectification or erasure.
- Restrict the processing of your personal information.
- If applicable, to data portability.
- Not be subject to automated decision-making.

In some circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

## DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

## HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS (GDPR)

Your data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Service, you understand and consent to the transfer of your information to the United States. We implement standard contractual clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission for transfers to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

## UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISMS

We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) and other universal opt-out mechanisms as required by U.S. state laws (e.g., CCPA/CPRA). If your browser sends a GPC signal, we will treat it as a valid opt-out request for targeted advertising and data sales.
